// 1379. Find a Corresponding Node of a Binary Tree in a Clone of That Tree
// Given two binary trees original and cloned and given a reference to a node target in the original tree.

// The cloned tree is a copy of the original tree.

// Return a reference to the same node in the cloned tree.

// Note that you are not allowed to change any of the two trees or the target node and the answer must be a reference to a node in the cloned tree.

// Input: tree = [7,4,3,null,null,6,19], target = 3
// Output: 3
// Explanation: In all examples the original and cloned trees are shown. The target node is a green node from the original tree. The answer is the yellow node from the cloned tree.

// Input: tree = [7], target =  7
// Output: 7

// Input: tree = [8,null,6,null,5,null,4,null,3,null,2,null,1], target = 4
// Output: 4
