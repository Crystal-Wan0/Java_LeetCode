// 771. Jewels and Stones
// You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

// Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

// Example 1:

// Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
// Output: 3
// Example 2:

// Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
// Output: 0

class Solution {
    public int numJewelsInStones(String J, String S) {
        if(J.isEmpty()) return 0;
		int cnt = 0;
		for(int i = 0 ; i < S.length() ; i++) {
			if(J.indexOf(S.charAt(i)) != -1) cnt++;
		}
		return cnt;
    }
